## Climbing Nystrom's Mountain: building an interpreter

This is an interpreter for the lox programming language written in Java. 

Almost all of the code in this repo is copied straight from Robert Nystrom's lovely book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). Indeed, typing out Nystrom's code (along with solutions to some of his Challenges) is how I am forcing myself to read the book carefully.
