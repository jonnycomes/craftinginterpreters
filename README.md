## Climbing Nystrom's Mountain, Part II: jlox

This is an interpreter for the lox programming language written in Java. 

Almost all of the code in this repo was copied straight from Robert Nystrom's lovely book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). Indeed, typing out Nystrom's code (along with solutions to some of his Challenges) was how I forced myself to read the book carefully. 

The analogous repo for Part III of Nystrom's book can be found [here](https://github.com/jonnycomes/clox).
